"The Spelling Nemesis" is a role-playing-game (RPG) that tries to enstill the urgency of proper spelling within coding. Developers need to always check their code to ensure that it is running properly and smoothly. One mistake grammatically can cause the whole code to stop working. This game adds a light-hearted take on the importance of spelling as you take on the role of the character trying to find all the missing letters to be able to spell once again. But watch out, the spelling nemesis might find you and call you out on your terrible grammer abilities.

Project Topic:
	1. Creating a RPG inspired spelling nemesis game where you are thrown into a world where you need to find letters throughout the land to help fight the 	    spelling nemesis. When encountering the spelling nemesis, if you don’t have all the letters for a certain action (like attacking or defending yourself), the 	    spelling nemesis will proceed to embarrass you by attacking you… but also attacking your confidence with rude remarks. 

	2. Searching for letters [items, inventory] throughout the game. If you’re prompted to spell something, and spell it incorrectly, the spelling nemesis will find 	    and fight you. [encounter]
               You can’t beat the Spelling Nemesis unless you find letters that allow you to use certain actions.
               Throughout the game, you will find ‘letters’ that will give you access to better spelling. Start with:

	3. 

	4. 

	5. # PLAYER method (EXAMPLE)
		def attack()
		ttck (nothing)
		if inventory contains: ‘a’ —> attack
		efen (nothing)
		if inventory contains: ‘d’ —> defend
		he (nothing
		if inventory contains: ‘a’ and ‘l’  —> defend
		flee (40% chance)
