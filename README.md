"The Spelling Nemesis" is a role-playing-game (RPG) that tries to enstill the urgency of proper spelling within coding. Developers need to always check their code to ensure that it is running properly and smoothly. One mistake grammatically can cause the whole code to stop working. This game adds a light-hearted take on the importance of spelling as you take on the role of the character trying to find all the missing letters to be able to spell once again. But watch out, the spelling nemesis might find you and call you out on your terrible grammer abilities.
